# True dark theme!

### CREDIT
Credit where credit is due. This is not my idea and not even my code. I found this on reddit and somehow to forget the link to that post
However, I did re-write it using Vue.js as the original was in plain HTML, CSS & JavaScript and did a few tweaks to it.

### Demo (Works better with Mouse, touch not supported, might have to double tap)
